My recommendation is to use your PS4 to watch Netflix, DVDs, Blurays as well to optimize your experience of the product. For shows that do not require a low seat and a certain quality of sound, it is just like giving pizza to birds: it works but it does not worth it., For a wireless experience with any model of Xbox, Playstation or any home consoles: Ace Bayou wireless retrofit system is to be ordered separately ($35 to $55 before taxes), otherwise, the cables will do the trick just fine., + The immersive experience videogames/Netflix/DVD, + Wireless works well with PS4, + Ideal for low seat gamers, + Easy to store (foldable), - The cable management is a total mess if not using a PS4 or the separate retrofit system (adapter to be purchased for Xbox one controller), - The sound quality with the headphones is disappointing when plugged onto the chair, - Fabric is kind of fragile so if you intend to play shirtless in the middle of summer, put a bath towel on the chair before you sit", "is_Helpful": "45 people found this helpful"}, {"reviewerName": "Amazon Customer", "reviewerUrl": "https://www.amazon.com/gp/profile/amzn1.account.AEOT5R3H2S4ZETS3WE3Z2NB4J2MA/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_gw_btm?ie=UTF8", "rating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "reviewTitle": "Best chair ever", "reviewDate": "March 1, 2018", "reviewText": "\"  Best chair ever.
